-------------------------------

I am entirely disappointed with most of the console mpg123 frontends I have
seen, and because I already had my own weird format for indexing filename to
artist/title instead of the lame space-padded ID3 tags. But being the Linux
geek that I am, what is the only reasonable solution? Do it yourself! So
after a bit of hacking around, here is v0.8 of Matt's MP3 Selector (mms).
Feedback, bug reports, compaints etc to morganw@engr.sc.edu...

Piss poor documentation is available in the INSTRUCTIONS file.

PS - xmms is ripping off my name! I have witnesses!

PPS - I'm lazy. I require constant badgering to get anything done.

BUGS / ANNOYANCES:

1. If a file is NOT an mp3 file and it has a .mp3 extension, we core.
2. Doesn't remove non-existant files from the playlist/file list (doesnt even
   notice). Trivial fix, just havent quite got around to it yet =)
3. Screen flicker during scroll... Whats up wif dat!

TODO:

1. Support for editing and updating ID3 tags ?
2. A better way for reading ID3 tags and determining song length?
3. Make it work properly with stupid people's terminals (ie not 80x25)
   (fixed?)
4. Figure out why colors arent always the same on terminals (pana your term
   is screwed).
5. _maybe_ change everything to use ncurses panels so you can drag the
   windows around and stuff.
6. Add gpm support? (and moused?)
