-------------------------------

Why? Because I was entirely disappointed with most of the console mpg123
frontends I have seen, and because I already had my own weird format for
indexing filename to artist/title instead of the lame space-padded ID3 tags.
But being the geek that I am, what is the only reasonable solution? Do it
yourself! So after a bit of hacking around, here is v0.84 of Matt's MP3
Selector (mms). Feedback, bug reports, compaints etc to morganw@engr.sc.edu...

Piss poor documentation is available in the INSTRUCTIONS file. Also see 
INSTALL.

PS - xmms is ripping off my name! I have witnesses!

PPS - I'm lazy. I require constant badgering to get anything done.

BUGS / ANNOYANCES:

1. Doesn't remove non-existant files from the playlist/file list (doesnt even
   notice). Trivial fix, just havent quite got around to it yet =)
2. Screen flicker during scroll... Whats up wif dat!

TODO:

1.  Make it work properly with stupid people's terminals (ie not 80x25)
    (fixed?)
2.  Figure out why colors arent always the same on terminals (pana your term
    is screwed).
3.  ncurses panels are being used, now just need to add code to drag/expand
    with the mouse (hide too)
4.  Add sysmouse support under FreeBSD.
5.  Add a configuration panel, with save support.
6.  File browser for playlists?
7.  Configurable info window with printf style conversion formats.
8.  Method to add an entire directory / globbing.
