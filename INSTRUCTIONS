Loosely pieced together... read_key() is where this stuff is from...

********** NOTE ***********
If you core due to some lame bug, you may need to kill the mpg123
child process. It goes berzerk if you orphan it.

Customization:

Thanks to Trent Gamblin, you now have the option of an MMS rc file. Either
create your own .mmsrc or set the env variable MMSRC. An example
configuration file is provided, see "mmsrc".

Mouse Support (Linux only):

Also contributed by Trent Gamblin, support for GPM. I assume it works, I
haven't checked it out in Linux yet. I'll work in mouse support for FreeBSD
soon.

Navigation:

TAB cycles between active windows.
ARROW KEYS are for basic navigation. pgup/pgdn, home/end also work.
Pressing 'q' will quit.
F1 or 'l' will allow you to load a playlist. It overwrites the current playlist.
F2 will save the current playlist to a file.
 * in ALL windows:
   * 'f' OR the right arrow key will advance one song
   * 'b' OR the left arrow key will go back one song
   * 's' will stop the player
   * 'p' will pause the player
   * '+' will jump forward 1000 frames
   * '-' will jump backward 1000 frames
 * in the files window or playlist window:
   * 'e' will edit the ID3 tag of the selected mp3
 * in the files window:
   * \r is your friend. it adds files to the playlist and changes directories.
   * 'r' will rescan the current dir.
 * in the info window:
   * 'r' will randomize the playlist.
 * in the playlist window is where the good stuff goes on:
   * press enter on a song to play that one. when it finishes, the player
     will advance to the next one until it comes to the end or encounters
     an error in one of the mp3s (or mpg123 dies :)
   * DEL will remove a song from the playlist (unless it is playing!)
   * 'r' will randomize the playlist

Mouse:
 * left clicking on an mp3 in the files or playlist window will select it.
   if in the files window, left clicking again will add it to the playlist.
   if in the playlist window, left clicking again will play it.
 * left clicking the '<' and '>' arrows will move the selection bar up and
   down.
 * right clicking an mp3 in the playlist deletes it from the playlist.
