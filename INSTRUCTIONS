Loosely pieced together... read_key() is where this stuff is from...

********** NOTE ***********
If you core due to some lame bug, you may need to kill the mpg123
child process. It goes berzerk if you orphan it.

Customization:

Edit colors.h and replace it with the colors you want. Of course if you
don't love my default color scheme then you suck. Be careful though, you
could start messing up the bit fields if you dont follow the instructions.
Later on, this will be turned into a config file parsed at runtime (and
checked for errors to avoid user screwups).

Navigation:

TAB cycles between active windows.
ARROW KEYS are for basic navigation. pgup/pgdn, home/end also work.
Pressing 'q' will quit.
F1 or 'l' will allow you to load a playlist. It overwrites the current playlist.
F2 will save the current playlist to a file.
 * in ALL windows:
   * 'f' OR the right arrow key will advance one song
   * 'b' OR the left arrow key will go back one song
   * 's' will stop the player
   * 'p' will pause the player
   * '+' will jump forward 1000 frames
   * '-' will jump backward 1000 frames
 * in the files window:
   * \r is your friend. it adds files to the playlist and changes directories.
   * 'r' will rescan the current dir.
 * in the info window:
   * 'r' will randomize the playlist.
 * in the playlist window is where the good stuff goes on:
   * press enter on a song to play that one. when it finishes, the player
     will advance to the next one until it comes to the end or encounters
     an error in one of the mp3s (or mpg123 dies :)
   * DEL will remove a song from the playlist (unless it is playing!)
   * 'r' will randomize the playlist
