Quick installation:

1) You may need to edit the Makefile.
2) Type "make".
3) Move the binary "mms" to somewhere convenient, or run "make install" as
   root
4) Create a configuration file (example provided as mmsrc) in $HOME/.mmsrc.
   Set the path to the player and a couple of various options. This is also
   where you configure window sizes, positions and colors.
5) enjoy!
